    Description:
      Abstract:
        This data set includes urban areas in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  
        The data were derived from the 2010 TIGER/Line Urban Areas data set produced by the U.S. Census 
        Bureau.  The Census Bureau defines urban areas as places that represent densely developed 
        territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses.  In 
        general, these places consist of areas of high population density and urban land use.  
        
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use 
        of these data.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The 2010 Census data were generalized to eliminate narrow areas that only served as connections 
          between large urban areas, and to eliminate outlying areas that were smaller than 320 acres.  
          Small areas that were within 300 meters of larger urban areas were merged with the larger areas; 
          small, non-urban areas within urban areas were merged with the urban areas.  Water areas larger 
          than 320 acres, within the urban areas, were clipped out using the National Atlas Waterbodies 
          data as a mask.  Additional attributes were added for the State abbreviation and to describe the 
          urban area type.  Other attributes were adjusted as necessary.  Urban areas with several pieces 
          were merged into multi-part features.

          The map layer was saved in shapefile and in file geodatabase formats.
